### Ideas

----

For a job scheduler project in Java with a focus on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), you can implement several scheduling algorithms. Here are some common ones:

### 1. **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
- **Description**: Jobs are executed in the order they arrive.
- **Use Case**: Simple and easy to implement but may lead to the "convoy effect" (long jobs delay shorter ones).

### 2. **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Description**: Each job gets a fixed time slice (quantum). If a job isn't completed, it goes to the back of the queue.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for time-sharing systems, ensuring fairness.

### 3. **Shortest Job Next (SJN) / Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Description**: Executes the job with the shortest execution time first.
- **Use Case**: Minimizes average waiting time but requires knowledge of job execution times.

### 4. **Priority Scheduling**
- **Description**: Jobs are executed based on priority. Higher-priority jobs are executed first.
- **Use Case**: Useful when some jobs are more critical than others.

### 5. **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**
- **Description**: Jobs are divided into multiple queues based on priority or type, with each queue having its own scheduling algorithm.
- **Use Case**: Useful for systems with different types of jobs (e.g., interactive vs. batch).

### 6. **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling**
- **Description**: Similar to multilevel queue scheduling but allows jobs to move between queues based on their behavior.
- **Use Case**: Dynamically adjusts to job requirements, balancing fairness and efficiency.

### 7. **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)**
- **Description**: Jobs are scheduled based on their deadlines, with the earliest deadline executed first.
- **Use Case**: Common in real-time systems.

### 8. **Weighted Round Robin (WRR)**
- **Description**: Extends Round Robin by assigning weights to jobs, giving more time to higher-weighted jobs.
- **Use Case**: Useful when jobs have different resource requirements.

### 9. **Lottery Scheduling**
- **Description**: Jobs are assigned "lottery tickets," and the scheduler randomly selects a ticket to decide the next job.
- **Use Case**: Ensures probabilistic fairness.
- 

#### 10. **Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)**
- **Description**: Fixed-priority algorithm where shorter period tasks have higher priority.
- **Use Case**: Real-time systems with periodic tasks.
- **DSA Focus**: Priority queues, period calculations.

#### 11. **Min-Min and Max-Min Scheduling (used in Cloud Scheduling)**
- **Description**: Selects tasks based on minimum completion time or maximum minimum execution time.
- **Use Case**: Widely used in cloud or grid environments.
- **DSA Focus**: Greedy algorithms, matrices for job vs. machine mapping.

### 🔍 Additional Features You Could Add:

#### 🕒 1. **Gantt Chart Visualization (JavaFX)**
- Use a `Timeline` in JavaFX to animate the execution of jobs.
- Show colors per job, and dynamic labels for process IDs, burst times, etc.

#### 🔄 2. **Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive Versions**
- Implement both versions of SJF, Priority, and Round Robin.
- Visually show preemption in the Gantt chart.

#### 📊 3. **Performance Metrics**
After each scheduling run, display:
- **Turnaround Time**
- **Waiting Time**
- **Response Time**
- **CPU Utilization**
- **Throughput**

This is useful for comparing algorithms.

#### 🧪 4. **Random Job Generator**
Add a feature to generate jobs with:
- Random arrival times
- Random burst times
- Optional random priorities

Make it configurable via command line or GUI sliders (in JavaFX).

#### 💾 5. **Input/Output from Files**
- Load job definitions from a JSON or CSV file.
- Save simulation results for review or grading.

### ⚙️ DSA & System Design Add-ons

#### 📦 1. **Job Queues using Custom Data Structures**
- Create your own `CircularQueue`, `PriorityQueue`, or even `Fibonacci Heap` for advanced scheduling.
- Let users switch between standard Java collections and your custom implementations (for educational insight).

#### 🔁 2. **Simulation Speed Control**
- Add a JavaFX slider to adjust speed of job execution in the visualizer.

#### 🧠 3. **AI-based Dynamic Scheduler (Optional)**
- Train a basic reinforcement-learning model or rule-based system to pick the best algorithm depending on the job set.
- (e.g., If there are many short jobs, pick SJF; if priorities matter, go with Priority Scheduling)

### 🛠 Optional Advanced Concepts (If You Want to Stand Out Even More)

#### 📡 1. **Client-Server Model**
- Simulate a distributed scheduler by having multiple “job submitters” send jobs over sockets to a scheduler.

#### 📈 2. **Scheduling History / Logging**
- Log each simulation run with a timestamp to a SQLite or file-based DB.

#### 👥 3. **Multi-Core Scheduling**
- Extend your scheduler to simulate multiple processors handling jobs in parallel using threads.
